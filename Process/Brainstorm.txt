I think my favorite idea out of the ones I brainstormed is the idea of parrying to either gain ammo or reflect projectiles in the shmup, and I decided to go with parrying to gain ammo, maybe reflect projectiles as well as a power-up. Of Fullerton's formal elements, this mechanic would consider resources as an important element of the game since you have to parry to acquire ammo in order to defeat the opponents. There will be an element of boundaries as well, so you can't just run and only parry at the safest moments. This game will make the player play aggressively to reward them. Some player challenges I could include are faster projectiles, so they are harder to parry, but are required to gain ammo. If the reflect parry power-up is activated, players would actually have to get up close to the enemy to increase the chances of their projectile hitting them, but long shot reflects are also possible, the player will just need to predict where the enemy is heading and lead their shots.  The basic rule for the game is just to kill everything on screen by parrying and shooting. Players will also be bound in a space, have to avoid projectiles they can't parry, and will have a set amount of damage they can take before losing.
